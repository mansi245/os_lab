Operating Systems Lab Programs (Process Management)
1. Parent Prints Even Numbers, Child Prints Odd Numbers
Question:

Write a C program in which:

The parent process prints all even numbers from 1 to 20.
The child process prints all odd numbers from 1 to 20.
2. Create Three Child Processes
Question:

Write a C program to create three child processes using fork(). Each child process should print:

Its Child Number (Child 1, Child 2, Child 3)
Its Process ID (PID)
Its Parent Process ID (PPID)
3. Child Exit Status Using wait()
Question:

Write a C program where:

The child process exits with status code 10.
The parent process waits for the child using wait() and prints the child's exit status.
4. Demonstrate an Orphan Process
Question:

Write a C program to demonstrate an orphan process. The child process should print its:

Parent Process ID (PPID) before the parent terminates.
Parent Process ID (PPID) after the parent terminates.
Observe how the PPID changes after the parent exits.

5. Demonstrate a Zombie Process
Question:

Write a C program to demonstrate a zombie process. Observe the zombie process using the ps command before the parent calls wait().

6. Execute the date Command Using fork(), exec(), and wait()
Question:

Write a C program using fork(), exec(), and wait() to execute the date command. The parent process should wait for the child process to complete before terminating.
